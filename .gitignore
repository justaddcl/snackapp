# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.

/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

.env.*

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
# TODO Comment out this rule if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
